Um so um but I I'm I'm glad to see at this point that uh people are taking uh safety seriously and I'd I'd uh like to say tha thank you for holding this uh A.I. safety conference. I think actually it will go down in history as being very important.,safety,0.9950166940689087,59.2,2

I think it's r it's really qu quite profound um and um and and I do think overall that the potential is there for a artificial intelligence A.I. have most likely a positive effect um and to create a future of abundance where there is no scarcity of goods and services.

you you you talked a little bit about the the summit and thank you for being engaged in it which has been great and people enjoyed having you there participating in this dialogue.

You know my job is to protect the country and we can only do that if we develop the capability we need in our safety institute and then go in and make sure we can test the models before they are released Delighted. that that happened today.,safety,0.9797444343566895,178.34,1

Well I I generally think that that it is good for government to play a role when the public safety is is at risk. So um you know f really for the vast majority of software um the public safety is not at risk.,safety,0.8687371015548706,238.9,2
